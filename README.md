# HOMEWORK-C++

They program can encode and decode the text by Alexander Macedonian encrypting means but a range of symbols was entroduced
to look a bit modern and harder to decode.
Code was devided into separate files, vector object was implemented, exception handling was used to make the program more
user friendly, although none of structures or classes were used (did not see any logical solution).

I have included all the comments inside the files right to the command lines, hope that they are enough explanatory.

I have first done programming part in the codeblocks and later moved to visual studio but there as not enough time to
finish the work (I have uploaded the screenshot to record the progress) I was trying :D
